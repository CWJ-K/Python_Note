# Fundamental Concepts
## Text Streams
* contains printable characters and control characters that are organized into lines. Each line consists of zero or more characters and ends with a new-line character (\n)
## Binary Streams
* contains a sequence of bytes
  * e.g. 01010002

<br />

# Package
## io (input/output)
* deals with various types of I/O
* three main types
  * text I/O
  * binary I/O
  * raw I/O

### StringIO
* In-memory text streams
* inherits TextIOBase
* When to use? <br /> In cases where you want a file-like object that ACTS like a file, but is writing to an in-memory string buffer

        df = pd.read_csv(
            io.StringIO(response.content.decode("big5")),
            index_col=False
        )
